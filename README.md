Blog-Backend

This small Node.js backend application is part of my final project for the Full Stack Web Developer Course at Hamburg Coding School.

Features:
- serving an array of blog entries to my React app
- sorting blog entries by recent travel date
- receiving and handling of post requests from my React app
- replacing missing image links with placeholders
- adding current date as post date to posted entries
- pushing new entries to array
- running on Heroku
